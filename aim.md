The aim of this experiment is to understand and analyze TCP SYN Flood attacks. We will examine their impact on network resources and explore potential mitigation techniques. The experiment will also demonstrate how attackers exploit the TCP three-way handshake to overwhelm a server's resources, leading to a denial of service.
