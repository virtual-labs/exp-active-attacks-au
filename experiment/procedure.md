### Procedure

1. A TCP SYN Flood attack floods the network with connection requests, causing servers to wait for confirmation messages.
2. Start by selecting a free port and sending a SYN message.
3. Do not acknowledge the received acknowledgements, leading to the closure of the initiated connections.
4. The goal is to overwhelm at least one server by occupying all available ports, rendering it inaccessible to other users.
5. Once you've successfully overwhelmed a server, click "Verify" to finish the experiment.
6. Hover over a port to view its port number.
7. To accept acknowledgements, access the 'Respond' section on the server and choose the appropriate color and port number.
